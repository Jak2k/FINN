## Hello World!

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- `rustc hello.rs` to compile the code.
- `./hello` to run the code. (Doubble click on Windows)

To write a simple hello world program in Rust, you can use the code-snippet provided. You can then compile the code using the rust c command and run the executable. On windows, you can run the executable by double-clicking it. This is of course not a good way of building larger projects. Let's see how we can do the same with cargo.
