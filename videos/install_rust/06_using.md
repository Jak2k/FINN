## Using Rust

- `rustc` to compile Rust code (rarely used directly)
- `cargo` to work with Rust projects
  - `cargo new` to create a new package
  - `cargo build` to build a package
  - `cargo build --release` to build a release version
  - `cargo run` to run a package
  - `cargo test` to run your tests
  - `cargo fmt` to format all files
  - `cargo add <package>` to add a dependency to your project
- `rustup` to manage Rust versions and associated tools

%%%%%
Rust provides two main tools for working with Rust code: These are rust c and cargo. Rust c is the Rust compiler, but it is rarely used directly. cargo is the Rust package manager and build system. It is the recommended way to work with Rust projects. You can use cargo to create a new package, build and run it, run tests, and format files. You can also use cargo to add dependencies to your project. rustup is the tool you have used to install Rust, and it is also used to update Rust.
