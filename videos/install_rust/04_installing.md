Rustup asks you to choose between the default installation and a custom installation. The default installation installs the stable version of Rust and the associated tools. The custom installation allows you to choose the default toolchain and additional components to install. You can also choose the installation directory and whether to modify the PATH environment variable. The default installation is recommended for most users. If you are not sure, you can choose the default installation and change the installation later.
