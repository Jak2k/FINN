## Why rust?

- Memory safe (no segfaults or null pointer exceptions)
- Fast (as C)
- Fearless concurrency
- High-level abstractions without runtime cost

You might be wondering why you should learn the rust programming language. One of the main reasons is that rust is a memory safe language. This means that it is impossible to have null pointer exceptions or segfaults. This is a huge advantage over other languages like C or C-plus-plus. Many security vulnerabilities are caused by these types of errors. Rust is also almost as fast as C. Another strenth is concurrent programming as it is also a lot easier than in other languages. In rust, you get high-level abstractions without any runtime cost. This means that you can write code that is easy to read and understand, but still runs very fast.
